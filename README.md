# piHPSDR-compile-from-sources

NOTE: this is now **superseded** largely by the new manual in my main repo

https://github.com/dl1ycf/pihpsdr

in the file release/piHPSDR-Manual.pdf.


A description (pdf + odt) and a scripts.tar file for compiling piHPSDR/WSJTX/Fldigi/FreeDV from the sources on a RaspPi.
