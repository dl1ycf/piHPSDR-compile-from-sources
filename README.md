# piHPSDR-compile-from-sources

NOTE: this is now **superseded** largely by the new manual in my main repo

https://github.com/dl1ycf/pihpsdr

in the file release/piHPSDR-Manual.pdf.

There you can find detailed instructions on how to compile on
Linux (including Raspberry Pi) and MacOS in the Appendices.
